Hello lost wanderer!

Welcome to *Yet Another Information Security Blog*!

<img src="https://silviokusakawa.files.wordpress.com/2013/12/screen-shot-2013-12-31-at-7-02-44-pm.png" alt="alt text" width="200">

I am Usman, a (*newbie!*)Security Engineer at [Ebryx](https://www.ebryx.com). I will be using this blog to write about interesting things that I learn in the domains of cyber-security and digital forensics as I progress from being a **Jon Show** (according to my team lead, because I *know nothing*) to being a **Lethal Forensicator**!!!! (again a term by my team lead!).

Ok bye.
